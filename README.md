# REST API Guidelines

These [REST API Guidelines](Guidelines.md), as a design principle, encourage
application developers to make resources accessible to via one or more RESTful
HTTP interfaces. To provide the smoothest possible experience for developers on
platforms following these REST API Guidelines, REST APIs SHOULD follow
consistent design guidelines to make using them easy and intuitive.
